# floors

Definitions for floor materials and their texture hints.

- `catalog.ts`: list of floor materials and texture entries.
- `types.ts`: shared types for materials/textures.

Notes:
- `terrain` values should match map terrain strings (see `map/draft`).
- `textureId` is optional; rendering can fall back to a color.
